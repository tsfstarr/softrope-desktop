Softrope
========

**Notes**
You'll need to install Bass.NET into your GAC to compile. Have a look for it on http://www.un4seen.com/.
Softrope currently runs on Framework35 so you need the v2.0 Bass.NET DLL, added as a reference to SoftropeModel.

I contacted the mystery inventor about resurrecting Softrope and got no reply. Many thanks for your hard word Iain, wherever you are.
<br>Features and bugs that I want addressed will be kept here.
