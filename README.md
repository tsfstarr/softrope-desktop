Softrope
========

**Notes**

I contacted the mystery inventor about resurrecting Softrope and got no reply. 
<br>Many thanks for your hard work Iain, wherever you are.
<br>Features and bugs that I want addressed will be kept here.

**Development**

You'll need to install Bass.NET into your GAC to compile. Have a look for it on http://www.un4seen.com/.
Softrope currently runs on Framework35 so you need the v2.0 Bass.NET DLL, added as a reference to SoftropeModel.

**Known Bugs**

- Fails to set existing muted SoundEffectControl when playing from SceneEditor
- Discern why SoundEffectControl LevelMeter objects don't work
